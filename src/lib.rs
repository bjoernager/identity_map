//! `identity_map` is a Rust crate for mapping keys with associated values.
//!
//! This crate defines the [`IdentityMap`] and [`IdentitySet`] as analogues to the standard library's [`HashMap`](std::collections::HashMap) and [`HashSet`](std::collections::HashSet).
//! Contrary to the standard library, however, keys are in the identity collections transformed as if by using [the identity function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_function/).
//!
//! Using the identity function *may* make tables larger in size (depending on the key type), but does also allow for making the very same tables non-collidable.
//! The collections provided by this crate are ordered and required keys implementing [`Ord`] (as well as [`Eq`]).
